# Setting up your environment

My recommended development setup consists of Unix-like system, such as Linux, BSD or Mac OS X. At the time
of writing Linux is recommended due to optimal Valgrind support. Basic tools such as Autotools, pkg-config,
compilers etc should be installed as well. I will add a chapter later regarding compiling your extension on
Windows, but for now the focus shall be on systems like the ones mentioned above.

When doing extension development a debug build of PHP is recommended. The debug build is compiled
without optimisations, which is useful when the debugging with gdb or Valgrind. Debug build can be 
compiled by passing the following configure settings to PHP configure program:

    $ ./configure --enable-debug --disable-all --prefix=/opt/php-debug --enable-maintainer-zts

This will install a debug version of PHP to /opt/php-debug and does not interfere with your system-wide
installation. The enable-maintainer-zts flag enables Zend thread-safety and allows to catch some of the common
development errors early on.

# Basic extension layout

The minimal extension usually consists of three files: config.m4, a header file and an implementation file.
The config.m4 is used by phpize command-line tool to generate 'configure' -script. In a nutshell this file
defines how your extension is built, what libraries are linked etc.

The header file (.h) contains a few definitions (module_entry, version etc) and that's about it. In more complex
extensions there can be several header files, but even then the main header should be kept minimal.

The implementation file (.c) contains the extension implementation. This means module initialisation, per-request
initialisation, phpinfo-hooks, ini-entries and of course functions and classes. 

Naturally this is not the only way to lay out your extension but it's a good starting point. In more complex
extensions you might want to break the implementation into multiple files, for example one per class or one
file for the main extension and one file for helper functions. However, this is a matter of preference and
for the sake of this tutorial I shall not dive deeper into this.

There are a few additional files that will be introduced later, most importantly LICENSE, tests, package.xml and config.w32.

## Versioning

The versioning convention for PHP extensions is major.minor.patch and the initial release of your extension of
your extension should be 0.1.0, rather than for example 0.0.1. I don't know why this is, but it just happens to
be the convention followed in PECL.

## Setting up the boilerplate

Every extension contains certain amount of boilerplate code: the minimal header file, module entry, initialisation
of classes and resources etc.

A few words about naming your extension: If you read the PHP license carefully you will find the following section:

```
  4. Products derived from this software may not be called "PHP", nor
     may "PHP" appear in their name, without prior written permission
     from group@php.net.  You may indicate that your software works in
     conjunction with PHP by saying "Foo for PHP" instead of calling
     it "PHP Foo" or "phpfoo"
```

Hence, choose a name for your extension that does not contain "PHP" in it.

### config.m4

To get started with the development first thing to create is config.m4, the build-file. If your extension does not
link against external libraries this file will be very simple:

```
PHP_ARG_ENABLE(yourextension, whether to enable yourextension,
[  --enable-yourextension               Enable yourextension])

if test "$PHP_YOUREXTENSION" != "no"; then
  PHP_NEW_EXTENSION(yourextension, yourextension.c, $ext_shared)
fi
```

Ever wondered why some extensions use --with-xyz and some use --enable-xyz? The convention here (not enforced) is that
if you extension links against external libraries --with is used and if there are no external libraries involved then
--enable should be used. For example Imagick uses --with-imagick because it links against ImageMagick libraries.
